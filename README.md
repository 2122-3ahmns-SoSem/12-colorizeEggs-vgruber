# colorizeEggs-NotTemplate

Projectdescription: In ColorizeEggs the player has to fulfill an order of 12 eggs and color them accordingly.

The order is displayed in the upper-left corner. This order lists features:
- egg colors red, green, blue and how many of each is to be colored
- how many of the colors you have colored (this updates when eggs fall in the basket)

You can color the eggs using lamps and their on/off switches on the right-hand side. You can also turn off all at once.

Eggs fall down and rotate while doing so. 

When an order is completed or no eggs are left to color, the game stops and a message tells you if you lost or won.

To restart you must refresh.
